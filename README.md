üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Patterns
This app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to ensure a separation of concerns, making the code more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

Model: Represents the data layer, including the Data Access Object (DAO), repository pattern for Firestore, and data classes (JournalUser, Journal).

View: Consists of Activities and Fragments (MainActivity, SignUpActivity, JournalList, AddJournalActivity) that observe the ViewModel and display data.

ViewModel: Acts as a communication center between the Model and the View, holding UI-related data and surviving configuration changes.
